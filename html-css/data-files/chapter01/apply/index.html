    <p>CH 1, Apply Your Knowledge</p>

    <p>I am using Visual Studio Code to complete this assignment.</p>

    <p>You plan a website by figuring out the target audience. Figuring out navigation, colors, typography, and building a wireframe to see what the website could look like.</p>
    
    <p>I learned about planning for a website and the thought process that goes into it. I also learned some basic IT stuff about the web, history, and how it all connects.</p>
